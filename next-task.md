# Find Your Next Task

We do most of our work through sprints so if you are in one, make sure you are completing those tasks first since they are our current focus. If for some reason you are not in the sprint, because of onboarding or finished your tasks, follow the steps below.

If all else is completed, you can always read a book, take an online course or just think about how we could make the company better.

## Developers

 - Go through our [Zenhub Backlog](https://github.com/niteoweb/operations/issues#boards). Choose a task that you like and is not on a sprint then ask the Scrum Master if you can start working on it. 
 - Search the codebase and documentation for "TODO", "XXX" and similar strings. Try to understand why it's there and create a ticket for it. If you like the task, you can start working on it immediately. 

## DevOps and Support

 - First focus on whether our systems are running smoothly and that all our customers' issues have been resolved and answered. 
 - Review our [Handbook](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook) and [Intra](https://intra.niteoweb.com/) documents, updating as necessary.
 - If you are DevOps and have had no tasks for some time, you can join the next sprint.
 - If you are Support and have had a slow few days, start reading on how we could improve our support. This may include improving our processes or rewriting our responses.

## Marketing

 - Research other means of how we could make money. Read blog posts about innovative ways to gain leads and customers.

## Operations

 - Review our [Handbook](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook) and [Intra](https://intra.niteoweb.com/) documents, updating as necessary.    
 - Ask people what are the current issues they are facing and how we could resolve them.
