# Handling Support Requests

Email support is managed by [GrooveHQ](https://niteoweb.groovehq.com/), a mail-based ticketing system. Member sends an email through a contact form or directly, and a support ticket is created in GrooveHQ.

You should read everything we have on product websites (don’t forget footer links), related [intra](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/8c2f57844e2349e9b5de40cf5fad658a?_authenticator=296a0dcf711a0926896807e8b133c924bda5c0e4) articles, in our blogs and help centers – multiple times. Most questions visitors and members ask are answered on these pages.

## General Instructions

1. Do not add greetings at the end since they’re automatically added by the system.

2. Do not reply to tickets which are assigned to other agents, unless they are away and won't be back within 24 hours.

3. Try to reply to customers as soon as possible. Support tickets should be closed within 8 hours on weekdays and within 24 hours on weekends. So if you can, check support for urgent issues on Saturdays and Sundays.

4. Do not leave the customer without a reply for more than one work day. If nothing else, let him know we're looking into the issue. Nothing is worse than being ignored by support staff when you have issues.

5. Try to close tickets with just a single email instead of bouncing multiple emails with the user. That means be concise and resourceful.

6. Offer recommendations when in context. For example, a plugin is blocked by the system. We don't just tell the user that the plugin is blocked for a reason but we offer recommendations as a solution.

7. Make sure you read the ticket history with that person before replying. It might have information that’s relevant to the new ticket.

8. Be nice to all who send an email, even if they’re very rude (and some will be). Keep calm, reply with facts and thank them for any feedback. If they’re worried about their refund, cancellation or anything else, let them know we’ll do our all to fix things in their interest.

9. The conversation can be informal and smilies are allowed when in context.

10. Avoid saying YOU when replying to support tickets where the user messed something up.

Here's an example.

> It looks like you didn't properly unzip the file. Here's your fix.

Instead say

> It looks like the zip file didn't get properly extracted. Here's your fix.

People hate being made to feel stupid. If you remove the person from the response as if someone or something else messed up, they will remain much happier.

If something isn't clear, ask Dejan or Marbe. See our [policy on dealing with users](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/fe1828f8656f4538bd621b17b94d0dd0?_authenticator=296a0dcf711a0926896807e8b133c924bda5c0e4).

## Slack Channels

Support related issues and topics are discussed on #support channel. This way everyone knows what's going on and can ping in on the topic. Avoid pinging coworkers in private since then others won't know what's going on.

We also have the #support-emails channel for a live stream of GrooveHQ tickets and responses.

## Live Chat Support

Live chat function on our sales page. When working, login to [Olark](https://olark.com) so we can offer users live support.

Important: Always have your head with you when doing live chat support. It's a great venue to steal information or to exploit someone's account. Read [this article](https://medium.com/@espringe/amazon-s-customer-service-backdoor-be375b3428c4#.gspnzg3id). Again and again.

Instead of doing things for users, ask users to do it themselves - just guide them how.

Sample scenario: user wants you to change his login email.

* Incorrect: Asking for user's new login email and setting it yourself.
* Correct: Ask user to login to his account, go to Settings tab then update the information himself.

There are other scenarios but the general idea is that don't give anything to a user unless properly verified. One verification process is asking him to login to his account then checking logs for the login event.

## Using GrooveHQ

### Canned Replies

Pre-prepared replies to most common questions are available from the GrooveHQ user interface. You can use them and edit them as necessary.

If you have the need to create a new canned reply, you can do so by clicking Settings in top right corner of Groove HQ, and then under Ticketing click Canned Replies.

### Submit Statuses

Regular replies are always ‘Submit as Closed’. If there is still something you need to do after replying (like reporting a bug and getting back to the user with a solution), select ‘Submit as Pending’. Put as note any action done/being done or a link to an opened GitHub issue for easy reference.


### Spam Emails

Mark them as spam.

### Email Close

At the end of each email (where relevant) add the canned reply “Let me know if you have any other questions”, “Let me know if I can be of any help” or the canned reply that directs them to the Help Center.

### Reassigning Difficult Questions

If a question is too difficult to answer, reassign it to Marbe. She’ll be notified by mail and will take care of it from there on forward.

### Help Center

Help Centers is where the instructions and common questions by users are answered. Every product has its own Help Center which should be updated whenever questions become too common and users cannot find answers.
