# Using Signal

[Signal](https://signal.org/) is a secure end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging application. We use it for confidential messages that should not be sent via email or Slack.

## Getting started

### Install

To start using Signal you will require an Android phone or iPhone and a working phone number. Although there is a Signal desktop application it does still need to connect to the Signal app installed on your phone.

### Signal profile

Once Signal has been installed please fill out your Signal profile, in settings, with your GitHub handle and a photo with your face. These details are important to identify you to other Niteans in Signal.

### Niteo group chat

We have a Niteo group chat on Signal and you will need to be invited to join it. Please send your Signal phone number to someone in [PeopleOps] and they will add you to the group.

### Phone compatiblity

If your personal phone is not an Andriod or iPhone we advise getting a cheap 'work' phone with a prepaid sim card for secure communication.

## Usage

Signal is to be used primarily for these reasons:

* Sending confidential information that must never be shared over Slack.
* Timely instant messaging at conferences and IRLs. e.g. group messages for Niteans about scheduling food or meeting places. Remember to avoid disturbing non-participating Niteans by creating a new chat group for such events.

All other company instant messaging should remain on Slack.
