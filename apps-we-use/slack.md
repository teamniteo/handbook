# Using Slack

Slack is an awesome team collaboration tool that replaces IRC, Skype and much of our email communication.

## You

We are all human. And we like to know the humans on the other side of Slack. So please fill in your [profile page](https://niteo.slack.com/account/profile) and [upload your photo](https://niteo.slack.com/account/photo).

## When Working

Slack can be a big distraction if you're always receiving notifications. That is why we encourage you setup Do Not Disturb mode when you need time for undistracted work.

Set it up with the bell icon in top left corner.

Turning it off is in the same menu. We recommend being available around standup when people are taking care of support and will be available for questions. You will still see all notifications from people who pinged you when you come back to Slack.

## To All-In Or Not To All-In

It is recommended that you install the Slack app on your desktop and your phone so that you do not miss out on any messages directed to you and other informative communication. Google "slack <your platform>" and you should find the app.

However, some might not want to install new stuff on their devices. This is fine. You can use Slack through your browser. But if you do it this way, make sure you get email notifications for discussions in channels you participate in, for "mentions" and for direct messages.

## Main Channels

These are the main channels that we are all part of, and where most two-way communication happens:

* #operations - general company discussion
* #watercooler - watercooler discussion, non-biz related
* #out-of-office - see notifying away time
* #working-on - tell your coworkers what you're working on

For more detailed descriptions see channel "purposes" on Slack. Other channels are created on ad-hoc basis, when needed. One example is collaboration with external contractors/partners on a certain task -> in this case we create a dedicated channel and invite third party people as guests to this channel.

It is recommended that you "star" all above main channels, so they are always at the top of your channel list.


## Notifying Away Time 

If you have personal things to take care of, you most definitely should attend to them. Just make sure everyone else knows you are away, so we don't wait for your input. We use the #out-of-office channel for keeping everyone up-to-date with who is online and who is not.

If are running late, or need to leave early, just write something like "Running late, will be online in 2 hours.". If you will be away for the entire day, do the same.

However, if you are away more than one day, see [how to book a vacation](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/benefits.md#booking-vacation).

## Working On

If you missed a standup, to keep everyone in the loop on what you are working on, write a short report to the #working-on channel. This report should contain:

* one or two sentences on work you did today (high altitude overview, don't go into too much detail),
* plans for next day,
* any potential blockers that should be discussed during the next Hangout.

## Checklist

* Fill in your profile page and upload your photo.
* Do you know what to post where? 
* Do you know how to notify everyone about your away time?
* Do you know how to keep everyone in the loop about your current work?
* Enable two-factor authorization.
