# Using Slack

[Slack](slack.com) is an awesome team collaboration tool that is an alternative to IRC and Skype messaging, and replaces most of our email communication.

## Getting started

### Sign up

To start using Slack you will need to sign up to the company workspace using your `@niteo.co` email address:

* [Slack Niteo signup]

### App or browser

It is recommended that you install the [Slack app] on your desktop and your phone so that you do not miss out on any messages directed to you or other informative communication.

Some might not want to install new stuff on their devices, which is fine, as you can use Slack through your browser.

### Your profile

We are all human, and mostly harmless, so we like to know the human we are communicating with on the other side. Please fill in your [Slack profile] with your details and ensure that:

 * *Display name* matches your GitHub handle.
 * *Profile photo* displays your full face.

## Security

> *Main document: [Security](../company/security.md)*

### Two-factor authentication

Enable two-factor authentication: [Slack 2FA setup]

### Insecure messaging

Although we use Slack for our day-to-day communication, it is not a fully secure messaging system, since the messages are stored and accessible on their servers. Therefore do not transfer passwords, keys or confidential information using Slack.


## Channels

Slack channels are meeting rooms where team discussions take places. The following are the main channels that we are all part of:

* [`#operations`] - General company related discussion.
* [`#out-of-office`] - Notifying of days away, sick leave, vacation time or missing standups.
* [`#watercooler`] - Watercooler discussion so anything non-work related.

And there are channels dedicated to discussions for each company role:

* [`#design`]
* [`#development`]
* [`#marketing`]
* [`#support`]

It is recommended that you 'star' these main channels so they are always at the top of your channel list.

Other channels of note:

* [`#articles`] - Reading material of interest to co-workers for learning purposes.
* [`#user-thanks`] - Thanks from end-users for a great product and service.
* [`#wall-of-happy`] - Kudos and reactions between team members. see [Nitean recognition] for details.

For detailed channel descriptions see 'Purpose' under Channel details on Slack.

Other channels are created on an ad-hoc basis when needed. One example is a collaboration with external contractors/partners on a certain task -> in this case we create a dedicated channel and invite third-party people as guests to this channel.


## Notifications

Make sure you receive notifications for discussions in channels you participate in, for "mentions" and for direct messages. There are several different ways you can achieve this:

 * Desktop app
 * Mobile app
 * Browser with desktop notifications enabled
 * Email

### Announcements

Announcements can be made using `@username`, `@here`, `@channel` or `@everyone`. to get an individual or teams attention. Use these sparingly as they can disturb team members from their work. The `@channel` and `@everyone` notifications should be only used for very urgent issues as it will notify everyone, even if they are offline or away. The better alternative is `@here` that only notifies those who are online.

### Do not disturb

Slack can be a [big distraction] especially if you're always receiving notifications or checking for replies.

When you need time for undistracted work we encourage you to `Snooze notifications` for a preset period. Alternatively, you can quit Slack so not distracted by the notification icon or tempted to check in. However, if you are quitting Slack for a long stretch of the day, it is useful to let everyone know in `#out-of-office`. It is also recommended to set the `Do not disturb` schedule for non-working hours so you have completely undisturbed downtime.

You can set both of the notification options with the bell icon in the top left corner of Slack and you will still see all notifications from people who pinged you when you come back to Slack.

### Out of office

If you have personal things to take care of, you most definitely should attend to them. Just make sure everyone else knows you are away, so we don't wait for your input. We use the [`#out-of-office`] channel for keeping everyone up-to-date with who is available and who is not.

If are running late, or need to leave early, just write something like "Running late, will be online in 2 hours.". If you will be away for the entire day, do the same.

### Working on

If you will miss a standup, write a sentence in the [`#out-of-office`] channel to keep everyone informed. This should contain a sentence on what you have been working on (high altitude overview, not too much detail) and your plans for the day.

### Vacation

If you will be away for more than one day, see [booking vacation time](../people/benefits.md#booking-vacation) and write a reminder for everyone in [`#out-of-office`] just before you go away.
