# Investment Strategy

At Niteo, we like to be anti-fragile so that we can focus on the long term. We want to be able to survive an economic crisis or our projects suddenly spiraling out. For this reason, we keep monetary reserves to [cover nine months of average expenses](/5_People/profit-sharing.md).	 
 
To not lose this considerable chunk of money to inflation, we invest it into appreciating assets.

## Short-Term Pool

Reserves in safe and liquid assets. We try to keep the currency equally split between EUR and USD to not have all our eggs in one basket. Minimum 30% of all reserves should be in this pool so that we have cash on hand if we need to act quick.

Assets:
- cash on bank accounts (minimum 15% of total, default reserve)
- bonds (15% of total) with [Vanguard BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/bndw) (World-wide investment-grade bonds, in USD)


## Long-Term Pool

Reserves in more risky or illiquid assets. The currency split is irrelevant because most of these assets are global investments. Up to 70% of all reserves can be in this pool.

- real estate (max 20% of total) with [Niteo House](https://house.niteo.co) (EUR)
- stock ETFs (max 30% of total) with [Vanguard VWRA](https://www.vanguardinvestments.dk/portal/instl/dk/en/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=9679/assetCode=equity/?overview) (global stocks, in USD)
- private funds (max 30% of total) with [Calm Company Fund](https://calmfund.com/), [Ben Tossel's No-Code Fund](https://angel.co/v/back/ben-tossell), etc.
- loans (max 10% of total)
- FOMO (max 5%) -> crypto stuff, individual stocks


## Summary

Keep in mind the above percentages are maximum for each asset class and are not supposed to be all maxed out (that's why the total comes out to 110%). For example: if we have maxed out real estate, stock ETFs and private funds, we're already over the recommended maximum for long-term pool, and need to refrain from buying more crypto.
