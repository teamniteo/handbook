# How We Manage Documentation

We use the following services for storing information:

- **[GitHub](https://github.com/teamniteo)** - Code repository, company and project documentation, ticketing system for all our projects, as well as agile project management.
- **[Grafana](http://niteo.grafana.net)** - Company and project dashboards.
- **[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)** - Mostly used for spreadsheets.
- **[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)** - Cloud file sharing.
- **[1Password](https://my.1password.com/)** - All passwords and keys are stored in 1Password team account.

## What Goes Where?

Guidelines on which information goes where.

### All Tasks

- Any and all tasks need a GitHub issue, usually inside a project repository.

### Development

- Development workflow, guidelines, instructions and conventions are available on GitHub.

### Support

- Project support documentation and related documents are in the Support folder, within the specific project repository.
- General support documentation is published to the Handbook.

### Marketing

- Advertising reports and links to private spreadsheets are in GitHub issues.

### Operations

- Finance reports are published in our [monthly newsletters](https://github.com/teamniteo/ops/tree/master/newsletter) and available on [Scrooge](https://scrooge.niteo.co/company).
- Company work processes and general non-sensitive documentation is published to the Handbook.

### Handbook

- Checklists for operational issues should be stored in
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES` and then linked to in the Handbook, for example:

    `https://github.com/teamniteo/ops/issues/new?template=onboarding-trialist-1-start.md`

- Any templates for emails, contracts, etc. should be stored in the Handbook's `templates` directory.
