# Handling Support Requests

Email support is managed by [Intercom](https://app.intercom.io), a customer messaging platform that supports multiple channels. Support requests are sent via our contact forms, directly to support email address, social media pages (Facebook and Twitter), and through Intercom's Messenger (live chat).

Read everything we have on our project websites (don’t forget the footer links), project's support folder, project's blog and help center – multiple times. Most questions visitors and users ask are answered on these pages.

## General Instructions

1. Do not reply to tickets which are assigned to other agents, unless they are away and won't be back within 24 hours.

2. Do not leave the customer without a reply for more than one work day. If nothing else, let them know we're looking into the issue. Nothing is worse than being ignored by support when you have issues.

3. Try to close tickets with just a single email instead of bouncing multiple emails with the user. That means be concise and resourceful.

4. Offer recommendations when in context. For example: a plugin is blocked by the system. We don't just tell the user that the plugin is blocked for a reason but we offer recommendations as a solution.

5. Make sure you read the ticket history with that person before replying. It might have information that’s relevant to the new ticket.

6. Be nice to all who send an email even if they are not. Keep calm, reply with facts and thank them for any feedback. If they’re worried about their refund, cancellation or anything else, let them know we’ll do our best to fix things in their interest.

7. The conversation can be informal and smilies are allowed when in context.

8. Listen to what the customer is saying. Even if the customer is in the wrong, acknowledge what they are saying and then use that as a teachable moment. Having them learn how to resolve issues on their own is still the best customer experience.

9. Avoid saying YOU when replying to support tickets where the user messed something up.

Here's an example.

> It looks like you didn't properly unzip the file. Here's your fix.

Instead say

> It looks like the zip file didn't get properly extracted. Here's the fix.

People hate being made to feel stupid. If you remove the person from the response as if someone or something else messed up, they will remain much happier.

If something isn't clear, ask Dejan or Marbe. 

## Slack Channels

Support related issues and topics are discussed on the product's support channel, if there is one. This way everyone knows what's going on and can contribute to the topic. Avoid pinging coworkers in private since then others won't know what's going on.

## Live Chat Support

Intercom's Messenger app is available on our salespages. This makes it easier for customers to contact us for issues, requests or sales questions.

With Intercom, everything is in one dashboard - live chat and support emails. There's no need to switch pages so you can treat live chat conversations as another ticket to resolve. 

We have Operator Bots enabled so the customers are always referred to relevant help articles first.

**Important:** Always have your head with you when doing live chat support. It's a great venue to steal information or to exploit someone's account. Read [this article](https://medium.com/@espringe/amazon-s-customer-service-backdoor-be375b3428c4#.gspnzg3id). Again and again.

Instead of doing things for users, ask users to do it themselves - just guide them how.

Sample scenario: the user wants you to change their login email.

* Incorrect: Asking for the user's new login email and setting it yourself.
* Correct: Ask the user to log into their account, go to Settings tab, and then update the information themselves.

There are other scenarios but the general idea is that don't give anything to a user unless properly verified. One verification process is asking them to log in to their account then checking the logs for the login event.

## Using Intercom

### Canned Replies

Pre-prepared replies to most common questions are available on the Intercom user interface. You can use them and edit them as necessary. 

If you have the need to create a new canned reply, you can do so by clicking on the ribbon icon found in the bottom part of the reply box, and selecting `Create`. Managing canned replies can be done by clicking on the `Manage` option.

### Submit Statuses

Regular replies are always ‘Send and close’. If there is still something you need to do after replying (like reporting a bug and getting back to the user with a solution), click on the dropdown menu and send with the appropriate snooze time.

### Spam Emails

We handle spam by blocking the address. Just click on the hamburger menu button found at the top right corner beside the customer's name.

### Email Close

At the end of each email (where relevant) add the canned reply “Let me know if you have any other questions”, “Let me know if I can be of any help” or the canned reply that directs them to the Help Center.

### Reassigning Difficult Questions

If a question is too difficult to answer, re-assign it to someone qualified to take over the issue. Try to add a note to summarize the issue or your own take to it.

### Help Center

Help Centers are where the instructions and common questions by customers are answered. Every product has its own Help Center which should be updated regularly - add new information and remove outdated ones if any.

You can search and insert relevant help articles without leaving the Intercom dashboard. On the reply box, just click on the note icon and enter a keyword, then add it to your reply.
