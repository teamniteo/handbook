# Introduction

Everyone on Support (EOS) is a regular activity wherein all full-time members are called upon to do a Support shift once every month (this includes customer and tech support). Trialists and part-time team members are excluded from this.

EOS is not designed to make everyone Support or to be pulled from regular work to do support. The main reason why we're doing this is that a new set of eyes can help find issues and opportunities in current processes. A developer might see an obvious bug that was otherwise overlooked. A marketer might see a great opportunity that was dismissed till then.

In the end, we are working for our customers, and having everyone involved in the conversation will help improve their experience and make them happy. And happy customers are happy to spend money with us.

# Mechanics

### I. Instructions

* Start by reading our policy on handling support. See [Handling Support Requests](support.md).
* We have [documentation](https://github.com/niteoweb/easyblognetworks/tree/master/support) for the various support processes and tasks. To fast-track the onboarding process and get a good grasp of the common issues and tools we're using, start with these three articles:
  * [EBN - Support Tools](https://github.com/niteoweb/easyblognetworks/blob/master/support/support-tools-and-processes.md)
  * [EBN - Support Issues Checklist](https://github.com/niteoweb/easyblognetworks/blob/master/support/support-issues-checklist.md)
  * [EBN - Blog Problems Checklist](https://github.com/niteoweb/easyblognetworks/blob/master/support/blog-problems-checklist.md)
* We use [Intercom](https://app.intercom.io/) for handling support emails. For EOS, we have a predefined account which you'll need to personalize when you're on duty. Login credentials are on 1Password under *Team* vault. Update the profile by clicking on your name found at the bottom left corner of the page.
* Filter available tickets by selecting the `unassigned` folder.
* Everyone has *Staff* access to the EBN app, this allows you to log in to internal [*Blog Dashboard*](https://github.com/niteoweb/easyblognetworks/blob/master/support/blog-dashboard.md) app.
* We have the #ebn-support channel for support-related discussions and the #ebn-server-ops channel for server statuses and warnings.
* All support documents can be found in the project support folder ([EBN](https://github.com/niteoweb/easyblognetworks/tree/master/support)). Make sure you go through them regularly and suggest improvements where needed.

### II. Frequency

Report for EOS once every month. Having it as a full working day duty affords better ownership of user-facing problems.

### III. Schedule

Everyone will set their own schedule and keep with it. At the start of the month, update the [recurring Sprint Story](https://github.com/niteoweb/operations/issues/510) with your preferred date.
