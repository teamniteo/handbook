# Profit Sharing

We believe every Nitean should take part in the distribution of profit. This document describes how we manage profit distribution.


## The idea

We divide the profit into three parts, based on how we perceive time: the past, the present and the future.

Profit is distributed at the end of each quarter, based on the performance of the company.

**Profit is distributed only if cash reserves are high enough to cover 12 months of salaries and regular expenses in the case we lose our primary revenue stream.**


## 33% - PAST

This part goes to cover people that have believed in the company in the past, have invested into it, have lent money to it, etc.

Priority of payouts:
1. bank loans (to decrease interest rates),
2. personal loans,
3. investor payouts,
4. founder payouts.


## 33% - PRESENT

This part goes to cover work in the past quarter. The formula for how much a single person receives goes as follows:

* first you calculate "points" for each Nitean: number of hours of work done in the past quarter TIMES number of months at the company;
* then you use the following formula: (Nitean's points) / (total points) * (available profit);
* you get the gross amount of the each Nitean's share of profit distribution.


## 33% - FUTURE

This part stays in the company's bank account, and we use it for investments in the following quarter. This can be discounted prepayments for expenses so we lower our mid-term and long-term costs, paid supervised trainings from authorities in a field we're interested in, gadgets for research, conference fees and allowances, paid courses etc.


## 1% - Donations

One percent is left to reach 100%. We donate this percent to causes we believe in. Everyone submits their organization of choice, we then do a quick vote, and the organization with the most supporters gets the money.

Voting is done with [this Google Docs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qDPoaJ6DGBcSvgsVjZgVGRhGbasUmZ5wVZ5wUqw97HY/edit?usp=sharing) (team members only). At the end of each quarter, every Nitean casts their vote. The organization with the most total "points" (current quarter plus previous quarters) gets the donations and its points are reset zero (if the org wins by more than 1 point, the diff is carried over to next month). Other organizations keep their points for the next quarter. Everyone Nitean gets to cast four votes: three votes worth 1 point and one vote worth 3 points.
