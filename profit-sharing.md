## The concept

Profit is distributed at the end of each quarter, based on the performance of the company. We believe in donating to good causes and reserve 10% of this profit with the hope of making a big impact upon them. The remaining percentage of the profit is split three-ways (30% per part) based on how we perceive time: the past, the present and the future.

The profit will only be paid-out if cash reserves are high enough to cover 12 months of salaries and regular expenses. Just in case we lose our primary revenue stream and need to rely on the reserves.


## Past

This part rewards the people that have believed in the company in the past, have invested in it, have lent money to it, etc. The priority of payouts are as follows:

1. Bank loans (to decrease interest rates)
2. Personal loans
3. Investor payouts
4. Founder payouts


## Present

This part rewards the work achieved in the past quarter and is a logarithmic points scale based on length of time working for the company. The calculation of profit-share points for a single Nitean is as follows:

    points = log(months_at_company) * (1 - unpaid_vacation_ratio)

The profit share will only be reduced if unpaid vacation time has been used.

The resulting profit-share payout is calculated with this formula:

    profit-share = (Nitean's points) / (Total points) * (Available profit)

The payout will then be split over the following three months of salary payments.

## Future

This part stays in the company's bank account and is used for investing in the following quarter. This can be discounted prepayments for expenses so we lower our mid-term and long-term costs, paid supervised training from authorities in a field we're interested in, gadgets for research, conference fees and allowances, paid courses etc.


## Donations

The remaining part of the profit share is what we donate to charities and causes we believe in. Everyone in the company can submit a potential recipient of these donations with the organization getting the most votes receiving the money.

The organization voting takes place at the end of each quarter with every Nitean casting their votes. There are four votes to cast; Three votes worth 1 point and one vote worth 3 points. The list of organizations and the voting tally is kept in a [Zoho spreadsheet](https://docs.zoho.eu/file/wtxljad4438a51ea04a59b5dce7d3dce0d0ac) (for permanent Niteans only).

The organization with the most total "points" (current quarter plus previous quarters) gets the profit share donation. Then its points are reset to zero (if the organization wins by more than 1 point, the difference is carried over to next month). Other organizations keep their points for the next quarter. If there is a tie, the Partners decide the winner.

So far, we have donated to the following organizations:
