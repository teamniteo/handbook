# Benefits

## Productivity Allowance

Allowance can be used to pay any expenses that you believe can make you better at work. Some examples of such expenses (but not a finite list):

* conferences,
* a new phone, new computer, new monitor,
* a good microphone and camera for Hangouts,
* a gadget such as a Kindle or a Pebble watch,
* a Raspberry PI to play around and learn new things,
* a good chair or a standing desk,
* internet connection at a more reputable provider,
* membership at a local hackerspace,
* subscription to an on- or offline course,
* etc.

In other words: is something boosting your productivity and creativity? Good, feel free to buy it with your allowance, no questions asked. The monthly amounts compound every month, so whatever you do not spend this month, you can use the next month, or the one after.

At the beginning of the month, invoice the company the allowance amount spent in the previous month.

You can request an increase in allowance if you feel the current one doesn't cover expenses for you. You can spend a few months of future allowance. The maximum allowance balance you can keep is 18 months. That said, it's smart to keep at least a few months' allowance in case something breaks.

### Current Allowance (January 2018)

**Regular Monthly Allowance:** $150

**Founder's Monthly Allowance:** $300


## Conferences

We encourage you to attend conferences to improve your knowledge of a subject area and network with similar minded people. Try to give notice at least 10-14 days before attending a conference.

All expenses for the conference, such as transport, accommodation, fees, food, etc., are covered by your [allowance](#productivity-allowance) and the additional conference allowance.

The conference allowance accounts for all the days you are away at the conference and depends on amount of travelling and acclimatization required:

* $50/day for local conferences, in or near your home city.
* $200/day for international conferences.
* $300/day for intercontinental conferences.
* Bonus 50%/day if you give a 30-60min talk at the conference.

Conferences count as working days (7.5h per day). Transport to conferences counts too (up to 7.5h per day).

The conference bonus requires that you write a report about the conference when you get back. It can be published on Intra or on any of our blogs. The conference fee amount is reimbursed to the allowance.

For example, Dejan goes to a three day conference in London:

    * Conference fee is $500.
    * Flights, trains and taxis are $300.
    * Hotel and food is $400.

    Dejan charges the company $1200 in allowances so his conference allowance is calculated as:

    * $1500 (5 * $200/day + $500 for the conference fee)

    Before the trip Dejan's allowance was $500 in credit and after the trip it is now $800.


## Online and Offline Courses

We encourage you to take courses by paying for time spent on the course. A rough guideline is one course per quarter. The amount covered is based on how direct the benefit is from the course, based on the course syllabus.

* 50% for somewhat work related courses which do not have immediate benefit
* 100% for work related courses with immediate benefit

After finishing the course, you should write a short review of the course, for others to use when deciding whether to take a course or not.

The main limitation is that project work always has priority over course-related work.

If you need to pay a fee to participate in the course, use your [allowance](#productivity-allowance).



## Vacation

Everyone is entitled to 165 hours of vacation leave (22 days) in any calendar year. These hours are automatically used to substitute any missing hours when one doesn't fulfill the monthly work quota. Over/undertime hours are calculated every month for the previous month.

Birth of a child is 20 extra days of paid leave.

Death in the family is 3 extra days of paid leave.

### Booking Vacation

See [Planned Absences](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/dcf71b9c6b17430789ace610c9ac384a) on Intra. Post to #out-of-office channel on Slack when you add a new entry.

### Unused Vacation

Unused vacation hours in a calendar year can be carried over to the next year, but must be used by July 1st. If not, we are gonna have a serious conversation; everyone needs a break.

## Public holidays

We are from different parts of the World, and we have different customs when it comes to public holidays. The Americans have close to no public holidays, some countries have up to 20 public holidays per year (though some come on weekends). To avoid taking a break when your government tells you to instead of when you *need* a break, and to avoid "bad holiday years" when all public holidays come on weekends and are hence rendered moot, we have our own little approach to holidays:

* Everyone is entitled to one public holiday each month, whichever day they want.
* The one day is automatically calculated as one working day less every month.


## Sick leave

Everyone has the right to sick leave on days when (s)he doesn't feel capable of working. Sick leave day counts as 6 hours of work done. If you partly work on a sick leave day, the number of sick leave hours is proportionally reduced so that the total amount of work hours cannot exceed 7.5 for that day. In other words, sick leave hours cannot be used to gain any overtime hours, by the same principle as vacation leave hours cannot be used for that purpose either. Sick leave can and should be used when taking care of an ill child or spouse.

Formula: `(regular work day hours - hours done on a sick day) * 80% + hours done on sick day = tallied hours`

Example: 2 hours work on a sick day. `(7.5h - 2h) * 0.8 + 2h = 6.4h`
