# Catchups

Once every sprint (i.e. two weeks) Niteans have Catchup meetings (also called One on Ones) with a senior team member in order to catch up. This feedback is important as everyone works remotely so we have less contact and less of an idea of what's going on with individuals. We want to know how we can help everyone work and feel better in the company. It's also an opportunity to discuss your career at Niteo.

This is your opportunity to discuss anything you want so they should be treated as more of a *beer in a coffee shop* than an *interview-style* meeting.

Catchups and Career Path notes are stored in your private [Niteo Career](https://github.com/teamniteo/niteo-career) repository.


## Schedule

Meetings will be scheduled at a suitable time and day every two weeks. They can be on Zoom, by phone or in person. They are usually 30 minutes in length but can take longer if needed.

They should not be cancelled unless unavoidable, such as an emergency.

## Your meeting!

These meetings are primarily for you so feel free to set an agenda and lead the meeting. You can let us know about the progress of work in the last week, give private feedback about the work, working conditions, company, projects, ideas or anything else on your mind.

## Discussion Points

Use these questions as a guide for things to discuss and not as a questionnaire because a Catchup is not a "question and answer" meeting.

### Weekly

* What's on your mind?
* How has the previous week of work been for you? Are there any blockers we can discuss or remove?
* Which were your big wins/highlights since we last talked?
* Do you feel there is enough feedback about your work?
* How can I help you ...? (be more productive/happier at work/enjoy work more/etc.)
* Are there any meetings or discussions you feel you should be a part of that you're not? Are you included in any you don't want to be a part of?
