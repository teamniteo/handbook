# Nitean Recognition

As Niteans, we believe in celebrating small wins and recognizing achievements. By enabling Nitean recognition, we're boosting each other's morale, enhancing engagement and communication, and improving the overall company culture.

## Peer Recognition

To encourage peer recognition, we're using the [Bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly/) platform which enables Niteans to give each other micro-bonuses in the form of +1s. Big or small of an act, if it made you happy, recognize and reward it.

We took a page from the head of Googleâ€™s People Operations, Laszlo Bock, and created our own version of the [_wall-of-happy_](https://plus.google.com/+LaszloBock/posts/UzxkRpkvyf7). Instead of a physical wall where kudos are printed out, we have a Slack channel `#recognition` where you can see a steady stream of kudos and reactions.

Monitor the leaderboard on the [Bonusly analytics page](https://bonus.ly/analytics/leaderboards).

## Policy

Niteans get 20 points allowance every month. We're adopting the `+1` system. This literally means giving a +1 (not 2 or 5 points) whenever someone did something that deserves a recognition. Big or small, if you think it's noteworthy or made you happy, send the Nitean a bonus.

We highly encourage everyone to send at least one bonus a day. Take 2-3 minutes and think of all the things done or people who did something recently that deserves a recognition.

To give someone a bonus, use the format below.

```
/give +1 @nitean for doing a stellar job at designing our homepage.
```

The more +1's (peer recognition) you get, the more points you collect. Other Niteans who want to acknowledge the recognition can also give their +1 by clicking `Add on this bonus?`.

## Redeeming Points

To keep things interesting, Niteans can redeem their points from the [list of awesome rewards](https://bonus.ly/company/catalog_items?show=custom&country=SI) we have.

While trialists can already start collecting points, only permanent Niteans can redeem.
