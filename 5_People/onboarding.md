# Onboarding

## Welcome to Niteo

Congratulations on completing the interview process, and joining us here at Niteo. We very much look forward to having you on the team! This page is designed to help you navigate the onboarding process from reading the Handbook to completing the onboarding checklist.

## Trial Period

We don't believe in long interview processes with tricky questions and unrealistic tasks. We rather hire someone for a trial period to see if we fit nicely together.

The trial period lasts somewhere between 3 to 6 months. The trialist receives 70% of the salary in the first two months, 80% in the next two months, and 90% after that. The salary is calculated based on hours done in a month.

As a trialist you will not be included in [profit sharing](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/5_People/profit-sharing.md) and other [benefits](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/5_People/benefits.md), nor entitled to a [severance](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/5_People/salary-system.md#severance-policy) package.

## Anonymous Feedback

If at any time during your onboarding, or any later time, you feel like you need to provide feedback to Nejc and Dejan privately and/or anonymously, please use the [feedback form](https://niteoweb.github.io/feedback).

## GitHub

Regardless of your role, we all use GitHub for tracking our work, and if you come from a non-technical background, this might be new to you!

Before starting the onboarding process, you need to have a GitHub account. [Sign up](https://github.com/join), if you don't have one yet, preferably using a short and lowercase username, with no special characters. To get an idea, here are a few of our usernames: [@dmurko](https://github.com/dmurko), [@dz0ny](https://github.com/dz0ny), [@marbeann](https://github.com/marbeann), [@zupo](https://github.com/zupo).

## Getting Started

Throughout your first few days at Niteo, it is important to focus on the onboarding checklist.

The onboarding checklist is a GitHub issue created specifically for you. It tracks everything required for a successful onboarding. The list of tasks is ordered by the priority in which you need to tackle them.

Usually, it takes about ten working days to get through the onboarding issue, but this is just a rough guideline. At times the onboarding process might feel overwhelming so if you have any additional questions along the way, post a comment on your issue and _@mention_ someone from the [PeopleOps] team. When you are further along, you are welcome to ask questions in the `#operations` channel on Slack.

## Salary Payments

All Niteans issue invoices to the company. The invoice must include: your full name and address, company name and address, date of issue, invoice number, services done, amount and IBAN bank account. You can use an online [invoice generator](https://invoice-generator.com/) if you don't have your own.

### Payments outside IBAN area

For Niteans outside of IBAN area, the bank transfer might be a suboptimal solution due to high bank fees. For these, we use TransferWise.

If you would like to receive money with this method, please make sure your invoices include all of the required recipient and bank information. Also, add a note to the invoice:

> Please transfer the payment using TransferWise.

We can only send local currency with this method. Your salary will be recalculated into local currency automatically by TransferWise.
