# Profit Sharing

This document describes how we manage the distribution of the company's profit quarterly.

## The Concept

Profit is distributed at the end of each quarter, based on the company's performance. We believe in donating to good causes and reserve 1% of this profit with the hope of making a big impact on them. The remaining percentage of the profit is split three ways (33% per part) based on how we perceive time: the past, the present and the future.

The profit is paid out if cash reserves are high enough to cover nine months of expenses. We define the required reserves as nine months of the last six months' average expenses.

We also pay out a yearly profit. To "force" ourselves into having a yearly profit, we put a pre-defined amount into a separate account ("profit budget") each month and mark it as an expense. So if we just break zero operationally, we still have some profits to pay from this separate account at the end of the year. The profit from this account is paid out even if the yearly operational profit is negative, but only after we cover cash reserves for nine months of expenses.

### Past

This part rewards the people who have previously believed in the company and invested their time, capital, and effort into building it. Specifically, it is used to pay dividends to founders and co-owners based on their ownership stakes.


### Present

This part rewards the work achieved in the past quarter and is a logarithmic points scale based on the length of time working for the company. The calculation of profit-share points for a single Nitean is as follows:

    points = months_at_company/log(months_at_company) * (1 - unpaid_vacation_ratio)

The profit share will only be reduced if unpaid vacation time has been used.

The resulting profit-share payout is calculated with this formula:

    profit-share = (Nitean's points) / (Total points) * (Available profit)

Profit-sharing payouts are done once every quarter.

### Future

This part stays in the company's bank account and is used for investing in the following quarter. This can be discounted prepayments for expenses so we lower our mid-term and long-term costs, paid supervised training from authorities in a field we're interested in, gadgets for research, conference fees and allowances, paid courses etc.


## Donations

The remaining part of the profit share goes into donation budget for the following year. We donate to charities and organizations that support software that we use every day. 

The donation commitee (currently @karantan and @zupo) decide how much and who to donate to on a case-by-case basis. If there is unspent donation budget at the end of the year, it is put into profit budget to be paid out. 

You can see the organizations we've donated to on the [About Niteo page](https://niteo.co/about).
