# How We Manage Documentation

We use the following services for storing information:

- **GitHub** - Code repository and ticketing system for all our projects, also hosts this Handbook where we write all company processes that can be publicly published.
- **[Intra](https://intra.niteoweb.com)** - Project documentation, team members profiles, reports and anything else that cannot be publicly published on the Handbook.
- **[Docs](http://docs.niteoweb.com)** - Technical documentation for projects, generated automatically by Sphinx on every code change. Also a ton of books and videos from our past events.
- **Resilio** - Works similar to Dropbox, but is much more secure as encrypts all data locally and it does not require a central server. Used for storing operations and projects files, that are being actively used.
- **JungleDisk** - Archive of no-longer-needed operations and projects files. Files can be accessed on demand.
- **1Password** - All passwords are stored in 1Password team account.

## What Goes Where?

Guidelines on which information goes where.

### All Tasks

- Any and all tasks need a GitHub issue, either in project repository or under one of the department ones, like Operations or Marketing.

### Development

- Development workflow, guidelines, instructions and conventions are available at [docs.niteoweb.com](http://docs.niteoweb.com/pyramid_bimt/process.html). You can add/update the documentation in `pyramid_bimt` repository under `/docs`.

### Support

- Checklists, support documentation and other support documents should be posted to Intra, in the specific project folder.
- General documentation should be posted to Handbook.

### Marketing

- Advertising reports and links to private spreadsheets should be posted on Intra, in the specific project folder.

### Operations

- Finance reports and meeting minutes should be posted on Intra.
- Company work processes and general documentation should be posted to Handbook.
