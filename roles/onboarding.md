# Onboarding

## Welcome to Niteo

Congratulations on completing the interview process, and joining us here at Niteo. We very much look forward to having you on the team! This page is designed to help you navigate the onboarding process from reading the Handbook to completing the onboarding checklist.

## GitHub

Regardless of your role, we all use GitHub for tracking our work, and if you come from a non-technical background, this might be new to you!

Before starting the onboarding process, you need to have a GitHub account. [Sign up](https://github.com/join), if you don't have one yet, preferably using a short and lowercase username, with no special characters. To get an idea, here are a few of our usernames: [@dmurko](https://github.com/dmurko), [@dz0ny](https://github.com/dz0ny), [@marbeann](https://github.com/marbeann), [@zupo](https://github.com/zupo).

## Trial Period

We don't believe in long interview processes with tricky questions and unrealistic tasks. We rather hire someone for a trial period to see if we fit nicely together.

The trial period lasts somewhere between 3 to 6 months. Normally, the trialist receives roughly 70% of the salary others earn in a similar position (there can be exceptions).

As a trialist you will not be included in [profit sharing](people/profit-sharing.md) and other [benefits](people/benefits.md), nor entitled to a [severance](people/salary.md#severance) package.

## Getting Started

Throughout your first few days at Niteo, it is important to focus on the onboarding checklist.

The onboarding checklist is a GitHub issue created specifically for you. It tracks everything required for a successful onboarding. The list of tasks is ordered by the priority in which you need to tackle them. Whenever a checkbox in an issue is ticked you should also post a comment. We then have a paper trail of checkbox changes since GitHub doesn't show this.

Usually, it takes about ten working days to get through the onboarding issue, but this is just a rough guideline. At times the onboarding process might feel overwhelming so if you have any additional questions along the way, post a comment on your issue and _@mention_ someone from the [PeopleOps] team. When you are further along, you are welcome to ask questions in the `#operations` channel on Slack.

## Anonymous Feedback

If at any time during your onboarding, or any later time, you feel like you need to provide feedback to Nejc and Dejan privately and/or anonymously, please use the [feedback form](https://niteoweb.github.io/feedback).
