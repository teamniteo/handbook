# Hiring

## Hiring collaboration

[Workable](https://www.workable.com/) is an all-in-one recruiting SaaS. We use it to source and evaluate candidates, track applicants and keep all information in one place so we can then make informed decisions on who to hire.

## Hiring process

### Overview

We strive to have a bureaucracy- and ego-free hiring process that provides a welcoming experience for new Niteans. It's impossible to thoroughly test someone's fit with interviews and phone calls, so we instead do a couple of general tests and then take them on for a [trial period].

That should be your mindset when conducting interviews: you are not searching for an ideal candidate. You are only on the lookout for big "no-no"'s. If someone lacks some skills, they can acquire them. If someone is used to different type of tools or processes, they can learn ours. Look for problem-solving prowess, ability to communicate what went wrong and ownership of mistakes.

### Hiring workflow

Workable guides us through the following stages of hiring a new Nitean. A candidate should expect to wait up to 5 business days between each step of the process.

1. Sourcing

   We post the job ads to various free and paid options, on a per-position basis, but here's a general idea:
   * Workable posts to 15+ US-based free boards automatically (Glassdoor, Indeed).
   * We post manually to Slovenian boards: slo-tech.com, internetmojster.com, facebook.com/groups/sluzbezadeveloperje.
   * We post to twitter.com/teamniteo and facebook.com/niteo.
   * Sometimes we run an ad campaign on Facebook or buy ads on StackOverflow.

2. Application

   Interested candidates get to our Application Form, hosted by Workable. The form needs to be short, with only general questions. Resist the temptation to ask advanced (technical) questions to assess needed skills for the position. We do these in the next step.

3. Questionnaire

   Members of the hiring team rate (+1/-1) candidates based on application form answers. Whoever gets two or more +1s gets transitioned to the next step: the Questionnaire. Use the `Advanced Questionnaire - <position>` email template to send the questions/tasks to the candidate.

   When the answers arrive we rate the candidate using the scorecard that is prepared in advance and matches the `Advanced Questionnaire - <position>` template. Discussion happens in comments inside Workable, so everything is kept in one place.

   Whoever gets two or more +1s gets transitioned to the next step: Phone Screen.

4. Phone Screen

   A chat over Skype, Hangouts or Zoom with @marbeann. Calls can last anywhere between 10 and 30. The goal is to confirm the candidate is able to communicate via video conferencing. Is their connection OK? Is their English OK? Can they hold a discussion on a subject?

   @marbeann also confirms the following:
   * Weekly commitment for the trial period (full- or part-time).
   * When can they start?

5. Interview

   Before the interview we need to select the Nitean who will mentor the candidate should the candidate start the trial period.

   Then the proposed mentor for the candidate and at least one of founders, along with anyone who is interested or will work with the candidate, get on Zoom to have a chat with the candidate.

   Structure of the interview:
   1. Introduce everyone.
   2. Say a few words about Niteo.
   3. Let the candidate say a few words about them.
   4. Go through Application Form and Questionnaire answers. Pick a few and go deep. Only someone who really worked on a particular problem can go deep.
   5. Is the candidate owning their mistakes or are failures always others' fault?
   6. Do they learn from their mistakes and change their ways in order not to repeat them?
   7. Why do they use the tools and techniques they use? Is it because "things are this way" or they have a specific reason why this tool/technique makes them better in some way?
   8. What do they do outside of their work life? Any volunteering perhaps? Open Source contributions? Activity in non-profit organizations?
   9. Discuss salary. Go through our "you set your own salary" policy, profit sharing and other benefits. Ask the candidate to think about their salary for a day or two and get back to us with a figure.

6. Offer

   After the candidate sends over their expected salary, everyone involved with the hiring gets on Zoom to do the final review of the application. We decide whether or not to offer the candidate a trial position in Niteo. Part of the positive reply should be:
   * trial salary,
   * start date,
   * weekly commitment (full or part-time),
   * next step if they accept the offer: onboarding.

7. Hired

   The candidate accepts our offer, and we start the [onboarding process].
