# Daily Standup Meeting

## Overview

[Daily standup] meetings are short meetings every day where we go over the work done on the previous day and to be done the same/next day. It is also where we discuss any blockers and where project managers can keep a tab on workload.


## Instructions

Every weekday morning at [10 A.M. CET/CEST](#timezones) we have a standup meeting on [Zoom](https://zoom.us). You need the software and an account with email `@niteo.co`. If you have issues connecting or have a poor internet connection but still want to join, you can [phone-in to a local number](https://zoom.us/zoomconference). You will need the meeting ID which is always the same and announced in the `#operations` channel before standup starts.

One by one we'll go over the things done in the last day, things to be done and any blockers anyone has and resolve them. If there was a new feature published, this should be mentioned so people can update their workflows if it concerns them.

If you're missing that day, add a note in the `#out-of-office` Slack channel.

We start gathering in the meeting room about 10 minutes before standup, to have some chit-chat and to catch up with each other. If you are finishing up something, by all means, continue to do so until standup starts, but if you can, join in and share how your evening was and what great movie/concert/meme you saw recently. The standup will start sharp so be on time!

Since we are a remote-first team we don't get to meet in person very often. So to get a few of the social vibes across, please turn on your camera during the standup. If possible, do stand up. It helps us to be concise and to the point. Try to refrain from doing other things (browsing, doing support, etc.) during the meeting -- it rarely takes more than 15 minutes and we should all pay attention to everyone else for this period.


## Checklist

Before the meeting, take a minute to note:

* Things you've done the last day.
* Things you'll be doing this/next day.
* Any blockers or help you need with tasks.
* New features that were published and people should know about.
* Turn on your camera. Disable any distractions, don't do anything else during the Stand Up.

## Timezones

Normal references to times, across the company, are made using [UTC], however, the daily morning meeting time needs to account for daylight savings time and the locations of Niteans around the world, from U.K. to the Philippines. Therefore to keep everyone's local meeting time between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. the meeting timezone is set to CET ([Central European Time]) or CEST (Central European Summer Time), during summer months.
