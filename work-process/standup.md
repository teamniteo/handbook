# Daily Stand Up Meeting

## Overview
Daily stand up meetings are short meetings every day where we go over the work done in the last day and to be done the same/next day. It is also where we discuss any blockers and where project managers can keep a tab on work load.

 
## Instructions
Every day at 9AM UTC (10AM CET) we have a stand up meeting on [Zoom.us](https://zoom.us). You need the sofware and an account with email @niteo.co. If you have issues connecting or have a poor internet connection but still want to join, you can [phone-in to a local number](https://zoom.us/zoomconference). You will need the meeting ID which is always the same and seen on #operations channel when standup starts.

One by one we'll go over the things done in the last day, things to be done and any blockers anyone has and resolve them. If there was a new feature published, this should be mentioned so people can update their work flows if it concerns them. 

If you're missing that day (conference and vacation excluded), add a note in #working-on Slack channel.

We start gathering in our Hangout room 10 minutes before standup, to have some chit-chat and to catchup with each other. If you are finishing up something, by all means continue to do so until standup starts, but if you can, join in and share how your evening was and what great movie/concert/meme you saw recently. The Stand Up starts at 10:00 CET sharp! 

Since we are a remote-first team we don't get to meet in person very often. So to get at least a bit of social vibes across, please turn on your camera during the Stand Up. If possible, do stand up. It helps us to be concise and to the point. By all means, refrain from doing other things (browsing, doing support, etc.) during the meeting -- it rarely takes more than 15 minutes and we should all pay attention to everyone else for this period. 
 

## Checklist

Before the meeting, take a minute to note:

* Things you've done the last day.
* Things you'll be doing this/next day.
* Any blockers or help you need with tasks.
* New features that were published and people should know about.
* Turn on your camera. Disable any distractions, don't do anything else during the Stand Up.
