# Onboarding

## Welcome to Niteo

Congratulations on completing the interview process, and joining us here at Niteo. We are very much looking forward to having you on the team! This page is designed to help you navigate the onboarding process from reading the Handbook to completing the so-called "onboarding issue". Regardless of your role, we all use GitHub for tracking what we do, and if you come from a non-technical background, this might be new to you! The onboarding issue is a single issue that tracks everything that needs to be done for a successful onboarding. At times the onboarding issue might feel overwhelming so if you have any additional questions along the way, post a comment on your issue and @mention someone from the @niteoweb/peopleops team. Alternatively, when you are a further down the onboarding issue, you are always welcome to ask questions in the #operations channel on Slack.

Before you can start the onboarding process, you need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, sign up at https://github.com/join. Use a short and preferably lowercase username, with no special characters. See a few of our usernames, to get an idea: @dmurko, @dz0ny, @marbeann, @zupo. Let the person who led the interview process know what your GitHub username is. When you signup to Slack, make sure to use the same username/handle as on GitHub.


## Trial Period

We don't believe in long interview processes with tricky questions and unrealistic tasks. We rather hire someone for a trial period to see if we fit nicely together.

The trial period lasts somewhere between 3 to 6 months. Normally, the trialist receives roughly 70% of the salary others earn in a similar position (there can be exceptions).

The trialist is not included in [profit sharing](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/profit-sharing.md) and other [benefits](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/benefits.md) and does not get a [severance](#lay-off--severance-policy) package.


## Getting Started

Throughout your first few days at Niteo, it is important to focus on the onboarding issue. The onboarding issue is specific to you, for an idea what is in there, please see the template below. This guide will help you understand what is in the onboarding issue, and why we are asking you to complete the items on the issue.

The onboarding issue has a list of tasks that you need to do, and they are ordered by priority in which you need to tackle them.

Usually, it takes about ten working days to get through the onboarding issue, but this is just a rough guideline.

That is it! Go to your onboarding issue and start checking things off!


## PeopleOps checklist

A member of the @niteoweb/peopleops team will do the following to start the onboarding process:

* Add the new team member to the [@niteoweb/trialists](https://github.com/orgs/niteoweb/teams/trialists) group so they get access to [niteoweb/operations](https://github.com/niteoweb/operations) and [niteoweb/handbook](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook) repositories.
* Create an onboarding issue based on the template below and assign it to the new team member.
* Send the first email (see First Email email template below).
* Create @teamniteo.com email address and send over credentials (see Niteo Email Account email template below).


## Lay Off / Severance Policy

While many of us are good friends, we are still a business, not a family. Unlike a family, people join and leave us from time to time. Whenever we have to let someone go, this is how we do it.

* The person needs to know at least 1 month in advance that their position could be canceled in the near term.
* The person needs to know that if we will be hiring for the same position again in the future, they will have priority over completely new people.
* All Partners need to agree with cancellation.
* When cancellation is agreed, the person should be notified immediately. From this point onwards, the person is no longer required to work, but is encouraged to take their time to hand off to other people in the Niteo anything they feel is valuable. After hand-off is finished they are free to do whatever.
* Every Nitean (except Trialists) is entitled to a severance package according to the following formula:
  * up to one year: 1 month base salary,
  * more than one year: 2 months base salary + 1 month for each additional year, up to max 12 months total.

Hello and welcome to Niteo! If you have not done so yet, please read https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/onboarding.md to get an idea of what this is.


Gearing up
==========

### Email Setup
* [ ] A member of the @niteoweb/peopleops team will create your very own `<initials>@teamniteo.com` email address. Use it for all Niteo-related communication, internally and with third-party contacts. Please ask if you would prefer a different address.
* [ ] We use S/MIME encryption for all email communication so install a desktop-based email client that supports S/MIME encryption e.g.  Apple Mail or Mozilla Thunderbird. *(Please do not use Web-based clients)*.
* [ ] Generate a [free Comodo Certificate](https://www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php) *(Chrome users: There were past problems with Comodo's form, try using Firefox if nothing happens)*.
* [ ] Configure S/MIME encryption for your email client. You will need to Google configuration details for your particular email client and verify that encryption works by emailing someone from the @niteoweb/peopleops team.
* [ ] Set up your [email signature](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/onboarding.md). Google how to do it for your email client of choice. Choose whatever title you want.
* [ ] Upload your photo for your @teamniteo.com email on [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/). Please use a photo where your face is visible. We are a remote team and having a cat for the avatar does not help in building a relationship with others.
* [ ] Add your @teamniteo.com email to your [GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/).

### Team Communication
* [ ] Signup to [Zoom](https://zoom.us/signup), our video conferencing software.
* [ ] Signup to [Slack](https://join.slack.com/niteoweb/signup). This is our Team Chat and please use your GitHub username as your display name.
* [ ] Read [Using Slack](https://github.com/niteoweb/handbook/blob/master/using-slack.md). Take some time to read through old messages in main channels to get an idea of how we function.
* [ ] Signup to [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). This ensures all our correspondence has the correct US English spelling and grammar.
* [ ] Introduce yourself by saying 'Hi' and writing a sentence about yourself in the #operations Slack channel.

### VPN and Intra
* [ ] With email setup, now configure the OpenVPN secure tunnel so you can connect to our internal services. Mac users should install `Tunnelblick` app and Linux users the `openvpn` package. Then ask @zupo (post comment to this issue) to email you the OpenVPN configuration files, which you normally double-click on and follow the instructions.
* [ ] Once connected to our VPN you will be able to access https://intra.niteoweb.com/. Ask @niteoweb/peopleops (post comment to this issue) to create an account for you along with your [Team Member Page](https://intra.niteoweb.com/people/team-members) on Intra. Your login credentials will arrive in a separate email.

Hey!

Welcome to Niteo! We keep everything related to work on GitHub so I will be short:

# [Email Template] Niteo Email Account

```
Hey!

Here's your Niteo email. You'll be using it for communication with us and for subscribing to websites.

w: https://apps.rackspace.com/
u: [email]
p: [pass]

Please change your password immediately after you login. You can do that in the top right Settings menu.

Configure the email on your desktop app, find the instructions here: https://emailhelp.rackspace.com

The next thing that you need to do is set up S/MIME email encryption. Generate a Comodo Certificate at https://www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php. You’ll need to Google on how to set encryption on your desktop app.

This email is signed with my cert, you should be able to reply with an encrypted message, signed with your cert so that I can then reply back with an encrypted message as well.

Once you have encryption ready, I’m sending over more information.


Regards
```


# [Email Template] OpenVPN Access

```
Hey!

Now that encryption is configured, you need to configure OpenVPN so you can connect to our internal services.

Configuration files are attached, normally you just double-click them and follow instructions.

When you manage to connect to our VPN you will then be able to access our internal services, such as http://docs.niteoweb.com/.


Regards
```
