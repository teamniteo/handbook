# Onboarding

## Welcome to Niteo

Congratulations on completing the interview process, and joining us here at Niteo. We are very much looking forward to having you on the team! This page is designed to help you navigate the onboarding process from reading the Handbook to completing the so-called "onboarding issue". Regardless of your role, we all use GitHub for tracking what we do, and if you come from a non-technical background, this might be new to you! The onboarding issue is a single issue that tracks everything that needs to be done for a successful onboarding. At times the onboarding issue might feel overwhelming so if you have any additional questions along the way, post a comment on your issue and @mention someone from the @niteoweb/peopleops team. Alternatively, when you are a further down the onboarding issue, you are always welcome to ask questions in the #operations channel on Slack.

Before you can start the onboarding process, you need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, sign up at https://github.com/join. Use a short and preferably lowercase username, with no special characters. See a few of our usernames, to get an idea: @dmurko, @dz0ny, @marbeann, @zupo. Let the person who led the interview process know what your GitHub username is. When you signup to Slack, make sure to use the same username/handle as on GitHub.


## Trial Period

We don't believe in long interview processes with tricky questions and unrealistic tasks. We rather hire someone for a trial period to see if we fit nicely together.

The trial period lasts somewhere between 3 to 6 months. Normally, the trialist receives roughly 70% of the salary others earn in a similar position (there can be exceptions).

As a trialist you will not be included in [profit sharing](profit-sharing.md) and other [benefits](benefits.md), nor entitled to a [severance](salary.md#severance) package.

## Getting Started

Throughout your first few days at Niteo, it is important to focus on the onboarding issue. The onboarding issue is specific to you, for an idea what is in there, please see the template below. This guide will help you understand what is in the onboarding issue, and why we are asking you to complete the items on the issue.

The onboarding issue has a list of tasks that you need to do, and they are ordered by priority in which you need to tackle them.

Usually, it takes about ten working days to get through the onboarding issue, but this is just a rough guideline.

That is it! Go to your onboarding issue and start checking things off!
