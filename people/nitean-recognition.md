# Nitean recognition

As Niteans, we believe in celebrating small wins and recognizing achievements. By enabling Nitean recognition, we're boosting each other's morale, enhancing engagement and communication, and improving the overall company culture.

## Wall of Happy

This is inspired by head of Googleâ€™s People Operations, [Laszlo Bock](https://plus.google.com/+LaszloBock/posts/UzxkRpkvyf7). He has a Wall of Happy outside his office where kudos are printed and put on a physical wall.

Instead of a physical wall, we have a Slack channel `wall-of-happy` where you can see a steady stream of kudos and reactions, enabled by the [Bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly/) peer recognition platform. Monitor leader board here: https://bonus.ly/analytics/leaderboards.

## Policy

Niteans get 10 points allowance every month. We're adopting the `+1` system. This means that whenever you give someone a bonus, you give that person 1 point.

```
/give +1 @nitean for doing a stellar job at designing our homepage
```

The more +1 (peer recognition) you get, the more points you collect. Instead of reactions, other Niteans who want to acknowledge the recognition can also give their +1 by clicking `Add on this bonus?`.

Niteans can optionally add company values hashtag to every bonus given. Our company values are #openness, #fairness, #curiosity.


In addition to peer recognition, we also have a basic reward system. Niteans can [redeem the Holiday reward](https://bonus.ly/company/rewards/new) for 50 points and gain one day off from work, to put their feet up and relax.
