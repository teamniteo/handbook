# Catchup meetings

We like to arrange, with everyone, weekly informal meetings (1-on-1) with a senior team member in order to *catch up*. This feedback is important as everyone works remotely so we have less contact and less of an idea of what's going on with individuals. We want to know how we can help everyone work and feel better in the company.

This is your opportunity to discuss anything you want so they should be treated as more of a *beer in a coffee shop* than an *interview-style* meeting.

## Schedule

Meetings will be scheduled at a suitable time and day every week. They can be on Zoom, by phone or in person. They are usually 30 minutes in length but can take longer if needed.

They should not be cancelled unless unavoidable, such as an emergency.

## Your meeting!

These meetings are primarily for you so feel free to set an agenda and lead the meeting. You can let us know about the progress of work in the last week, give private feedback about the work, working conditions, company, projects, ideas or anything else on your mind.


## Discussion points

### Weekly

* How has the previous week of work been for you? Are there any blockers we can discuss or remove?
* How do you feel about your workload? (high, low, or just right)
* Do you feel there is enough feedback about your work?
* Are you clear about the priorities for this sprint, and the quarter goals?

### Quarterly (or every few months)

* What makes you excited and motivated to work on a project?
* In terms of goals for the future, what direction do you want to develop your skills?
* Do you feel we are fairly compensating everyone, including you?
* What is the company, as a whole, doing right? Is there anything we should be doing and are not? What is the *#1 problem* at our company and why?
* Are we clearly explaining how the company is doing right now and where we want to go?

### As things come up

* Do you feel challenged at work? Are you learning new things?
* What recent achievements are you proudest of?
* Have you any half-baked ideas for projects, the company or anything else?
