## Setting Your Salary

Because we live in different parts of the world, have different lifestyles and different tax laws it's almost impossible for the company to set a fair salary for everyone. Therefore, **we give the biggest weight to your own proposal** for your salary. We have a maximum salary cap which is five times that of the current minimum salary in the company. We also publish founders' salaries as a benchmark.

While salaries are currently still private information (as per voting on [IRL#2](https://intra.niteoweb.com/operations/irl-2)), **we highly encourage salary discussion** between Niteans. Everyone is free to ask and answer (or not) questions about salaries to help them decide on what would be a fair salary for them. Everyone is also free to propose that someone should have a higher/lower salary or that we should increase minimum salary (which is the only way to increase the maximum salary).


## Current Company Salaries (January 2017)

All amounts are gross (total cost to the company). Some people take care of their own taxes and for some the company pays them, however the gross salary is the same.

**Minimum salary:** 650 EUR

**Maximum salary:** 3250 EUR

**Founder's salary:** 2500 EUR


## What to consider when setting your salary?

The main idea to keep in mind is: base salary gives you a *bit painful* lower-middle-class salary that covers your expenses while [profit sharing](profit-sharing.md) gives you the luxury and brings you in the higher class. We want the large majority of salary to come from profit sharing so that the company is able to survive challenging times with as low fixed expenses as possible, but so that everyone gets a big cut of the profit when we're doing well.

You should also consider internal and external factors:
* your responsibilities in the company, how independent you are at your job, seniority;
* your country's purchasing power, your role market rate, dependants (children, spouses).

We've set the founder's salary as a middle-class salary in Ljubljana, Slovenia. There are multiple indexes you can check to see how your country/city compares to Ljubljana, the easiest one to use is [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/).


## When can I request changes to my salary?

You can request a change to your salary sometime in the last month of the quarter. This way we'll have time to finalize the agreement by the end of the quarter, so it goes into effect in the new one.


## Working Hours

Each month everyone is expected to work (on average) 7.5 hours per working day in that month (lunch time not included). Any additional hours are considered as overtime hours and are worth 130% of your hourly wage (which is your monthly salary divided by 150).

On the contrary, if the monthly quota is not reached, that month's salary is reduced by 130% of hourly wage for every missing hour (that is, of course, after considering vacation and sick leave hours).


## Tracking Actual Working Hours

All time spent doing work-related activities counts as working hours. The only exception is the commute to the office. Working hours include reading the documentation, answering emails, attending conferences, etc.

Track all hours spent working for the company:
* in the office
* working from home
* working from any other location
* meeting
* transport to a meeting
* conference (1 conference day = 7.5 hours)
* transport to a conference (up to 7.5 hours per day)
* reading purposefully chosen technical material
* participation in courses
* do not track non-meeting lunch

Everyone tracks working hours for themselves. At the end of each month, send your **total working hours *and* sick leave days** to Dejan. We don't need breakdown per day or per task. You don't need to count vacation hours or sick leave, all that is done automatically and the balance posted to your [Intra profile](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/8027d5b5-0b78-4a85-8d43-d419c82e98fd) at the beginning of each month.

# Lay Off / Severance Policy

While many of us are good friends, we are still a business, not a family. Unlike a family, people join and leave us from time to time. Whenever we have to let someone go, this is how we do it.

* The person needs to know at least 1 month in advance that their position could be canceled in the near term.
* The person needs to know that if we will be hiring for the same position again in the future, they will have priority over completely new people.
* All Partners need to agree with cancellation.
* When cancellation is agreed, the person should be notified immediately. From this point onwards, the person is no longer required to work, but is encouraged to take their time to hand off to other people in the Niteo anything they feel is valuable. After hand-off is finished they are free to do whatever.
* Every Nitean (except Trialists) is entitled to a severance package according to the following formula:
  * up to one year: 1 month base salary,
  * more than one year: 2 months base salary + 1 month for each additional year, up to max 12 months total.
