## Profit sharing

> *Main document: [Profit sharing](profit-sharing.md)*

We believe every Nitean should take part in the distribution of the company profits. So every quarter, if the company is doing well, we reward those who stay with us.

## Allowances

Your productivity allowance can be used to pay for any expenses that you believe can improve your work. Some examples of such expenses (but definitely not a finite list):

* A new phone, computer or monitor.
* A good microphone and camera for meetings.
* A good work chair or a standing desk.
* Internet connection with a static IP at a reputable provider.
* Attend a conference.
* Membership of a local hackerspace.
* Subscription to an online or offline course.
* A gadget such as a Kindle or a Pebble watch.
* A Raspberry PI to play around with and learn new things.

In other words, would something boost your productivity and creativity? Good, feel free to buy it with your allowance, no questions asked.

### Monthly allowance

The current rates as of *February 2017* are:

 * Niteans: _$150_
 * Founders: _$300_

At the beginning of the month, invoice the company with the amount of allowance spent in the previous month. The monthly amounts compound every month, so whatever you do not spend this month, you can use the next month, or the one after.

You can request an increase in your allowance if you feel the current one doesn't cover all the expenses for you. You can spend a few months of future allowance. The maximum allowance balance you can keep is 18 months. That said, it's smart to keep at least a few months allowance, just in case something breaks.

### Software purchasing

Any software or tools that are a requirement for your role at Niteo, e.g. Photoshop for designers, will be a company expense and is separate from your allowance.

  * Personal accounts (e.g. Adobe Cloud): A monthly company expense that Niteo reimburses.
  * Company account with sub-users: Dejan will signup as Niteo and send login details to users.

## Conferences

We encourage you to attend conferences to improve your knowledge of a subject area and network with similar minded people. Try to give notice at least 10-14 days before attending a conference.

All expenses for the conference, such as transport, accommodation, fees, food, etc., are covered by your [allowance](#productivity-allowance) and the additional conference allowance.

### Conference allowance

The conference allowance accounts for all the days you are away at the conference and depends on the amount of travelling and acclimatization required:

* $50/day for local conferences, in or near your home city.
* $200/day for international conferences.
* $300/day for intercontinental conferences.
* Bonus 50%/day if you give a 30-60min talk at the conference.

Conferences count as working days (7.5h per day). Transport to conferences counts too (up to 7.5h per day).

The conference bonus requires that you write a report about the conference when you get back. It can be published on Intra or on any of our blogs. The conference fee amount is reimbursed using your allowance.

For example, Dejan goes to a three-day conference in London:

    * Conference fee is $500.
    * Flights, trains and taxis are $300.
    * Hotel and food are $400.

    Dejan charges the company $1200 in allowances so his conference allowance is calculated as:

    * $1500 (5 * $200/day + $500 for the conference fee)

    Before the trip, Dejan's allowance was $500 in credit and after the trip, it is now $800.


## Courses

We encourage you to take courses by paying for time spent on the course, either online or offline. A rough guideline is one course per quarter. The amount covered is based on how direct the benefit is from the course, based on the course syllabus.

* 50% for loosely work-related courses which do not have an immediate benefit.
* 100% for work-related courses with immediate benefits.

After finishing the course, you should write a short review of the course, for others to use when deciding whether to take a course or not.

The main limitation is that project work always has priority over course-related work.

If you need to pay a fee to participate in the course, use your [allowance](#productivity-allowance).


## Vacation

Everyone is entitled to 165 hours of vacation leave (22 days) in any calendar year. These hours are automatically used to substitute any missing hours when one doesn't fulfill the monthly work quota. Over/undertime hours are calculated every month for the previous month.

Birth of a child is 20 extra days of paid leave.

Death in the family is 3 extra days of paid leave.


### Booking vacation

To book vacation time off, see the Intra [Planned absences](https://intra.niteoweb.com/resolveuid/dcf71b9c6b17430789ace610c9ac384a) page. Remember to post to `#out-of-office` channel on Slack whenever you add a new entry.


### Unused vacation

Unused vacation hours in a calendar year can be carried over to the next year but must be used by July 1st. If not, we are going to have a serious conversation because everyone needs a break.


### Unpaid vacation

If all your allocated vacation days have been taken you can take further vacation days but they will be unpaid.

Please ensure however that your department and associated work will not suffer during your absence. Also note that your quarterly profit share amount will be affected by the number of unpaid vacation days your take. See [Profit sharing](profit-sharing.md#present) for further details.


## Public holidays

We are from different parts of the World, and we have different customs when it comes to public holidays. The Americans have close to no public holidays, some countries have up to 20 public holidays per year (though some come on weekends). To avoid taking a break when your government tells you to instead of when you *need* a break, and to avoid "bad holiday years" when all public holidays come on weekends and are hence rendered moot, we have our own little approach to holidays:

* Everyone is entitled to one public holiday each month, whichever day they want.
* The one day is automatically calculated as one working day less every month.


## Sick leave

Everyone has the right to sick leave on days when they don't feel capable of working. Partial work on a sick leave day proportionally reduces the total daily hours to not exceed 7.5 hours. In other words, sick leave hours cannot be used to gain any overtime hours, by the same principle as vacation leave hours cannot be used for that purpose either. Sick leave can and should be used when taking care of an ill child or spouse.

A sick leave day counts as 6 hours of work done. For partially worked sick leave days, we use the following formula:

    Tallied hours = (workday hours - worked sick-day hours ) * 80% + worked sick-day hours

An example for working for 2 hours on a sick day:

    (7.5h - 2h) * 0.8 + 2h = 6.4h
