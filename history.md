# History

Nejc and Dejan met in 2005 dragracing their moms’ cars (thanks moms!). Dejan was running a small local eCom store and Nejc was programming at a local development company. One thing led to another and in 2006 we built their first project - a website for helping young entrepreneurs start a company in Slovenia. In 2007 they formalized the business and at the same time founded Niteo, at that time, a web development company for building local business’ websites. We went through all the trauma that new and naive companies go through trying to build website (building for “references”, feature creep, “frugal” business owners, etc.).

Because we always had larger goals in 2009 we found ourselves partners in a local tech startup trying to address phishing on the Internet. Unfortunately, after 4 years of hard work and sweat we had absolutely nothing to show for it. Our contract was up and we went back to consulting work, this time for large international development companies.  

In 2010 we also launched our first SaaS product for the Internet Marketing niche on Warrior Forum. Though it was not an instant success, it showed us the industry had easy access to customers willing to pay for solutions. It took us another 4 years to take the plunge and go full SaaS. It was a stressful year transitioning but with a bit of luck and help from friends we made it. 

Since 2015 we’ve been a profitable SaaS company.
