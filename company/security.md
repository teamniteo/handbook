# Security policy

## General Guidelines

* Do not store sensitive information in plain text.
* Do not store sensitive information with any of the "big 10" cloud providers (MS, Google, Apple, Dropbox, etc.). Store information locally, on our internal infrastructure or with smaller providers (possibly non-US based).

## Passwords

### Computer Passwords

* All computers must have a login password.
* All computers must be locked with a password when kept running and left somewhere, even if only for a few minutes. 

### Web Application Passwords

* Use random passwords with more than 10 characters.
* Never use the same password more than once.
* Use a password manager to store passwords (1Password, LastPass, KeePass, etc.).
* Store password for company access to 1Password team account.

## VPN

We always use tunneling to access our internal servers from unknown networks to protect ourselves from traffic sniffing. All newer smart phones have some level of support for a VPN.

## Encryption

All data, without exceptions, needs to be encrypted on the fly. Encrypting just your user-folder is not enough, because some configurations and caches are still stored unencrypted and this presents a high security risk in case the device is stolen.

* iPhone supports hardware level encryption of all your data, you just need to enable it.
* Android has full disk encryption from version 7.0+ and enabled by default.
* Linux users should use LUKS and SecureBoot.
* Windows users should use native BitLocker.
* Mac (Lion and newer) users should use native FileVault.

## Theft Control

In case shit hits the fan and one of our devices gets stolen, we need a way to do some theft control.

* Macbooks and iPhones have that built-in. You can trace the device and also do a complete remote wipe of it.
* Linux laptops and Android phones get theft control with Preyproject.com.

## Syncing

Syncing of data between the device and any other device/service needs to be performed in a secure manner. Syncing over USB or local Wireless network is fine. Syncing through Dropbox, iCloud or Google Sync is *not* allowed as that would mean that all data is stored unencrypted at Dropbox/Apple/Google. 

## Webservices

Always, under all circumstances use SSL/TLS. If the service does not support SSL/TLS, do not even start using it!

## Sharing our customers' private information

If you need to share a list of emails of a subset of our customers, don't just blatantly send it over Slack, unencrypted and in plain text, that is in direct violation of our Terms of Service where we promise we won't share users' information with third parties. Same for GitHub, don't post lists of personal information there. Instead either send an encrypted email, or save to Resilio. These two methods make sure that only Niteo keeps the private information.
