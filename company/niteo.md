# Niteo - The future is bright.


## Why “Niteo”?

Niteo is a latin word meaning “to shine”, “to thrive”. We are tech futurists. We believe information technologies, or software if you want, will change the World for the better. Saying “those were the good old days” or “they used to live better in the past” is not something we do. Looking back, the human condition has improved several-fold, especially in the last few decades and it is due to increased information flow. The **purpose** of Niteo is to help improve lives, using information and software as the main driving force.


## The plan

Driving significant change for the better is a *Hard Task™*. We have tried that almost entirely off the bat when founding the company back in 2007. Without a tightly knit and highly skilled team and without any financial backing, we tried to make browsing the Internet a safer endeavor, effectively to kill of phishing attacks. We burnt out.

Then came the realization: what we need first are good foundations. A great core team with financial backing. So we set out to build a number of SaaS projects that, with little effort, could provide us with enough funds to attack the next Hard Task™. We’re nearly there. We’ve nearly reached our **vision** of building Niteo into a place where technologists solve hard problems, for the benefit of us all.

Our short-term **mission** is clear: help small businesses run better, simpler, easier and more profitable with our Software as a Service projects. In the meantime work on our long-term mission: find big problems that could be rendered a thing of the past by smart software.


## Our values

**Openness:** A bright future is one where information is free, not one where control is enforced through lack or limited information. We lead by example by publicly disclosing our documents such as this Handbook, by publishing our code under Open Source licenses, by giving everyone at Niteo full access to all our inner workings.

**Fairness:** A bright future is one where people are treated fairly and equally. A future where single entities control large portions of wealth and power is not a future we would like to see. We lead by example and work hard to make sure that everyone involved with Niteo is treated fairly.

**Curiosity:** A bright future is one where we can be curious. Where we are allowed to fail, so we can learn from our mistakes. Where we don’t have to blindly believe assumptions but we have the time and energy to test them, from first principles upwards. Where we read, ask, learn, every single day.
