# Niteo writing style guide

To mantain a simple concise style guide we have adopted the Wikipedia [Manual of Style] as our writing style for any kind of documentation or prose.

Here are some of the common styles that must be followed when writing documentation:

* Use [plain English] however even better is [Simplified English] to ensure accuracy.[1][plain English problems]
* Spelling and grammar are in American English. Use [Grammarly] to keep your writing correct.
* [Lists][MoS/Lists] should be sentence case
* [Headings and titles][MoS Article titles] should be sentence case.
* [Capital letters][MoS/Capital letters] should be used sparingly for the start of sentences, acronyms, proper nouns or trademarks. Common terms such as sprint, product owner, support are lowercase.

Some further additions to be loosely followed:

* Page length should be kept under 200 lines. Consider breaking into further pages if over this length.
* Use a table of contents to help navigate the page.
* Use [reference links] to put long URLs at the foot of the page instead of inline in the text. This helps with editing and version control diffs.
